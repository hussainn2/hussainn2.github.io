Meow show belly bite nose of your human no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out yet poop on floor and watch human clean up so flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower. Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! brown cats with pink ears but cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one jump off balcony, onto stranger's head or do doodoo in the litter-box, clickityclack on the piano, be frumpygrumpy, leave hair everywhere. Eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender. Attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently. Stretch i will be pet i will be pet and then i will hiss.
